The source for ipv4 bamboo can be obtained from:
	http://bamboo-dht.org/bamboo-cvs-2006-03-03.tgz
The source for ipv6 bamboo can be obtained from:
	http://lxpworkroom.googlepages.com/bamboo1.zip



Both ipv4 and ipv6 bamboos had an assertion error when a connection was closed at the bamboo, but was still alive at hipd. The assertion was fixed with these patches:
	bamboo_fix_TO_ipv4-20060303_FOR_assertion.diff
	bamboo_fix_TO_ipv6-20080612_FOR_assertion.diff



In order to create the /etc/init.d/ scripts for fedora, a small change to a file in both versions of bamboo was needed. The two patches for that are:
	bamboo_changes_TO_ipv4-20060303_FOR_fedora-script.diff
	bamboo_changes_TO_ipv6-20080612_FOR_fedora-script.diff



The patch for going from the ipv4 bamboo to the ipv6 bamboo is:
	bamboo_diff_FROM_ipv4-20060303_TO_ipv6-20080612.diff



The following patch was not created by me (Blerta Bishaj).
	bamboo-orig-cvs-2006-03-03-ipv6-luxiaopeng.diff



After the source has been obtained, it can be compiled by moving into the downloaded folder and executing 'make'.
For running bamboo, you have to execute (supposing you are still in the bamboo folder):
	bin/run-java bamboo.lss.DustDevil gateway.cfg
where gateway.cfg is a configuration file.



An example config file for ipv4 bamboo is in:
	http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/sklvarjo/sample.cfg
The port here can be changed from 3600/3602 to 5850.
Also, the min_replica_count value should be set to 1, since only one gateway is specified. The min_replica_count value specifies in how many dht servers the data is replicated.



In test/packaging/ inside hipd code, there are some sample /etc/init.d/ scripts for running both bamboo versions (ipv4 and ipv6) on fedora and ubuntu:
	ubuntu-init.d-bamboo_v4
	ubuntu-init.d-bamboo_v6
	fedora-init.d-bamboo_v4
	fedora-init.d-bamboo_v6
Later, we tried to limit the privileges of the user executing these scripts by:
- switching from 'daemon /home/bishaj/bamboo_v4/bin/run-java ... ' to 'daemon --user=nobody /home/bishaj/bamboo_v4/bin/run-java ... ', there might be some problems related to file rights and ownership caused by this.
- putting the bamboo source code inside the /opt/ folder

The scripts are now updated with the latest changes for reducing privileges.
-In ubuntu reducing privileges was straight-forward.
-In fedora, there were problems with user rights on the files.



One other thing to be careful about is when configuring the gateways. If there is one, this is fine:
    <initargs>
	gateway 193.167.187.133:5850
	leaf_set_size  4
	digit_values   2
	immediate_join true
    </initargs>
If there are several gateways to be configured, numbering them should start from 0, otherwise bamboo might crash (not always). Configuring can be like this for example:
    <initargs>
	gateway_count 1
	gateway_0 193.167.187.130:5850
	leaf_set_size  4
	digit_values   2
	immediate_join true
    </initargs>
