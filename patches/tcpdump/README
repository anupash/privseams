 HIP dissectors to TCPDUMP

 Newest version tcpdump-4.0.0-hip.03.patch

 If you find a bug in this (and there is no newer version) send mail describing the 
 bug to me. Please include packet captures resulting to the error.
 samu.varjonen@hiit.fi

 Some notes on usage:
 - If you get "[|hip]" on the end of the print out it means HIP packet is truncated
 - Use "-s 0" to get the snaplen large enough to capture whole HIP packet
 - Use "-n" to disable the transalation of addresses to fqdns so you'll see the                    
   addresses inside locators for instance
 - Verbose modes, if not present tcpdump will print 
   "IPsrc>IPdst HIP HITsrc>HITdst packetname"
   "-v" prints the HIP header
   "-vv" prints the HIP header and parameter names
   "-vvv" prints the HIP header and parameter names
   and also the contents of the parameters
