Currently, kernel 2.6.26 is used for Atheros target in the OpenWRT source tree.
If you are trying to build hipl for the Broadcom(brcm47xx) target, use patches
in 2.6.25 directory.

If you want to get a hipl patch for OpenWRT 8.09, try to look at 2.6.25
directory. That one can be directly used also for 2.6.26 kernel.
