2.6.19.7 BEET patch notes
==========================

This patch adds interfamily support (ability to translate IPv6 
application connections to IPv4 networking and vice versa) for BEET and 
TUNNEL mode to 2.6.19.7.

Kernel Compilation Incompatibilities
------------------------------------

The current hipd is not compatible with the mobile IPv6 extensions 
introduced in 2.6.19.7:

# CONFIG_XFRM_SUB_POLICY is not set
# CONFIG_SECURITY_NETWORK_XFRM is not set
# CONFIG_INET6_XFRM_MODE_ROUTEOPTIMIZATION is not set

See https://infrahip.hiit.fi/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=330

Disable them before compiling the kernel!

Test report
-----------

The current hipd has some options in hip_set_os_dep_variables() that 
handle dynamically some kernel API changes without breaking backwards 
compatibility with 2.6.17.14 (tested and works).

Test matrix:

           | outer ipv4 | outer ipv6
-----------+------------+-----------
inner ipv4 | works      | works   
inner ipv6 | works      | works   

Joakim Koskela fixed ESP sending that was not working for some pair of 
HTIs (bug id 175). Joakim Koskela solved also a problem with multiple 
simultaneous IPsec  connections on 2.6.18.0 in the latest hipd version 
(bug id 305).

Untested Features
-----------------

* Did not test TUNNEL mode at all.
* Testing with LSIs is TBD.
* The sleep patch is based on this patch rather than our previous 
  version:
  * http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=8eb9086f21c73b38b5ca27558db4c91d62d0e70b;hp=ba7808eac17360dda459f82222859b0e3879854b
  * Haven't done extensive testing yet on the new sleep patch.

Bugs
----

* Also applied ipsec loopback patch from here but it still oopses the 
  kernel in __xfrm6_bundle_create after calling xfrm_dst_lookup:
