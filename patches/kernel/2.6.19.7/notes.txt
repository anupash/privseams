2.6.19.7 BEET patch notes
==========================

This patch adds interfamily support (ability to translate IPv6 
application connections to IPv4 networking and vice versa) for BEET and 
TUNNEL mode to 2.6.19.7.

Kernel Compilation Incompatibilities
------------------------------------

The current hipd is not compatible with the mobile IPv6 extensions 
introduced in 2.6.19.7:

# CONFIG_XFRM_SUB_POLICY is not set
# CONFIG_SECURITY_NETWORK_XFRM is not set
# CONFIG_INET6_XFRM_MODE_ROUTEOPTIMIZATION is not set

See https://infrahip.hiit.fi/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=330

Disable them before compiling the kernel!

Test report
-----------

The current hipd has some options in hip_set_os_dep_variables() that 
handle dynamically some kernel API changes without breaking backwards 
compatibility with 2.6.17.14 (tested and works).

Test matrix:

           | outer ipv4 | outer ipv6
-----------+------------+-----------
inner ipv4 | untested   | untested
inner ipv6 | works      | untested

I tested this BEET patch against 2.6.17.14 BEET patch using hipd. Tested 
successfully with HITs (inner) and IPv4 (outer) addresses with ping6 and 
iperf. Works both with and without UDP encapsulation.

Joakim Koskela solved a problem with multiple simultaneous IPsec 
connections on 2.6.18.0. The same bug fix was included in this patch.

Untested Features
-----------------

* Did not test TUNNEL mode at all.
* Did not test yet with IPv6 address because IPv6 routing failed on 
  2.6.19.7: https://infrahip.hiit.fi/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=327
* Testing with LSIs is TBD.
* The sleep patch is based on this patch rather than our previous 
  version:

  * Haven't done extensive testing yet on the new sleep patch.

Bugs
----

* Sending ESP may not always work with some network/host configurations.
  Did not test yet whether the bug applies to this kernel version. See
  https://infrahip.hiit.fi/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=175
* Also applied ipsec loopback patch from here but it still oopses the 
  kernel in __xfrm6_bundle_create after calling xfrm_dst_lookup:
