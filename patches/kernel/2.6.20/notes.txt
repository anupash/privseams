HIPL 2.6.20 kernel patch notes 12.3.2010
========================================

This patch adds support for interfamily xfrm (beet, tunnel) as well as
the sleep-thingy and everything else needed to run HIP(L).

Note:

This patch has NOT been tested thoroughly and is considered
experimental, only for the brave (or desperate) enough stuck with the
2.6.20 kernel.
