/** @file
 * A teststub for certtools.c/h
 *
 * File for testing the main operations of certtools.
 * First this test takes the default HIT and the corresponding key.
 * Secondly it creates a certificate where itself is the issuer and the subject.
 * Then it tries to verify it. If it succeeds everything should be OK :)
