clock_test.awk
--------------
Requires an input file that is created by running command
  while true; do date +"%S %N"; done >output
for a while.

The purpose of the program is to measure the interval between two successive time stamps.
The data is then analyzed. Minimum, maximum and average intervals are printed.
Then 95% confidence interval is calculated, and the samples are subjected to the condifence interval.
Samples that don't fall into the confidence interval are discarded.
Then the same data analysis is recalculated for the remaining samples.

Example run:
while true; do date +"%S %N"; done >/tmp/clock
[^C to end]
./clock_test.awk < /tmp/clock
3474 samples, min/avg/max: 1953/2494/94987
Confidence interval 95%. Low/High bound: -1578/6568
Dropped at low bound 0 samples, at upper bound 17 samples
3457 samples qualified, min/avg/max: 1953/2414/6520
