The files in this directory are minimal, example configurations for the
linux kernel. You should select the one that matches the kernel version,
and modify it to suite your system! The kernel compilation process is
documented in linux/README, but we give a brief HOWTO for the brave and
impatient:

% cp <CONFIG_FILE_NAME> ../linux/.config
% cd ../linux
% make oldconfig        # in case you have picked out an old config
% make menuconfig       # modify the configuration according to your 
                          needs!
% make                  # build the kernel and modules
% make modules_install  # install modules
# su
# cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinux-hip-2.6
# cp System.map /boot/System.map-hip-2.6
# <edit /etc/lilo.conf or grub to suite your needs>
# reboot

The example configuration files are used on a AMD 32 bit host with an
IDE disk. The same configuration works also for a vmware virtual machine 
that is run in the same host.

The kernel provided in the HIPL software bundle is standard linux kernel
(with some HIP modifications). For this reason, if you run into problems
that are not HIP related, please consult the linux/README first before
asking any questions on the HIPL mailing list. There are also many
user forums out there in the Internet that may be helpful for
general questions about linux kernel configuration.

There is also a configuration derived from that used by Knoppix,
i.e. it is the 2.6 .config from Knoppix 3.6 with the addition that
IPv6 is compiled in and HIP is included.  This is provided since it is
expected that the Knoppix config would work out of the box on many
different kinds of systems.  This configuration has been tested with a
remastered Knoppix on a couple of systems.
