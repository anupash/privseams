    <title>Java API for HIP (JIP)</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>
      An API for Java applications using the HIP protocol.  This
      package provides an API for HIP, the Host Identity Protocol.
      Its functionality is comparable to that of the native API
      accessible for C programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The JIP API is divided into two parts.  The simpler one is the
      global API, the use of which makes all network communication in
      a Java application use HIP.  The global API is implemented with
      the extension mechanism of the {@link java.net} package.  The
      other one is the per-connection API, where an application may
      mix HIP sockets with normal sockets.  The per-connection API is
      implemented with the extension mechanism of the {@link
      javax.net} package.  For applications creating their own
      sockets, the per-connection API is recommended.
