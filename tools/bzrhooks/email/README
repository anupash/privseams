This is a plugin which implements post commmit emails for bzr.

The plugin is activated by:
 - installing it
 - configuring an address to send emails to (see ``bzr help email``).

Installation
------------

To install this plug in system wide, copy it into the plugins directory of the bzrlib.
You can find out the directory of the bzrlib by executing
    bzr version | grep bzrlib
This should be something like
    /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/bzrlib
Then you put the plugin into
    /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/bzrlib/plugins/email
That's all.

You can check the installation by executing
    bzr plugins
(email plugin should be displayed with a short message)
or
    bzr hooks
(post_change_branch_tip, pre_change_branch_tip should have entries from email-notification now)

Configuration
------------

To have bzr send an email you need to configure an address to send mail
to for that branch. To do this set the configuration option
    commit_notification_to
in the bazaar.conf, locations.conf or branch.conf. If there is no such address
configured for a specific branch, no email-notifications will be sent when changes
in this branch occur. Preferably, this option should be set in the branch.conf of each branch
separately.

The address from which the mail is sent is read from the configuration option
    ``commit_notification_sender``
If not supplied the name of the committer is taken as the originator.

Help
------------
All this should be displayed too, by executing
bzr email help
