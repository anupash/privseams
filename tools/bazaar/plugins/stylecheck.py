_stylecheck_tutorial = """
Bazaar plugin that prevents commits containing code style violations.

About
-----
This plugin runs the code beautifier 'uncrustify' on all files supported by
uncrustify and that are added or modified by a commit. If a file to commit and
the output of uncrustify differ, these differences are printed along with a
final summary of all non-conforming files and the commit is aborted. This hook
expects to find an uncrustify configuration file in the top-level directory of
the repository tree. It first looks for a file named '.uncrustify-<version>.cfg'
where <version> is the version of the locally installed uncrustify binary
available in PATH. If this version-specific configuration file is not found,
this hook looks for a file named '.uncrustify.cfg'. If no such file can be
found, an error message is printed, but the commit is not aborted and may
proceed normally.

Installation
------------
Copy this file into the bazaar plugin directory (usually .bazaar/plugins/ in
your home directory) or add the directory this file resides in to the
environment variable BZR_PLUGIN_PATH (export BZR_PLUGIN_PATH="<dir>") before
running 'bzr commit'. Make sure that the programs uncrustify, diff and patch
are available - this hook depends on them. If this hook cannot find a necessary
prerequisite for the style checks, it prints an error message and aborts the
commit. To disable the hook in such a case, remove this file from the bazaar
plugin directory (see Installation above).

Usage
-----
This hook is called automatically when running the command 'bzr commit' after
the commit message has been provided. If all added or modified files pass the
uncrustify check or none of the files are supported by uncrustify, the commit
continues normally. If the check fails due to a style violation, those
violations are printed as a unified diff between the new code and its
uncrustified version on standard output and the commit fails. Actual style
violations found this way should be fixed and the updated code should be
re-committed. If the commit is aborted because uncrustify incorrectly reports a
style violation in correctly formatted code, the uncrustify configuration file
should be adapted accordingly. If for some reason the commit should be forced
despite style violations, the bazaar commit option --no-plugins skips the style
check and allows the commit to succeed.
