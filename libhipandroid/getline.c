/* Read a line from the FILE stream into buf/buflen using fgets(), so up
 * to buflen-1 chars will be read and the result will be NUL terminated.
 * If the line has a trailing newline it will be removed.
 * If the line is too long, excess characters will be read until

 * isn't NULL, it will be changed to a description of the problem.
 * (The EOF message has a leading \n for cosmetic purposes).

 *	-1	error occurred
 *	-2	EOF encountered
 *	-3	line was too long
