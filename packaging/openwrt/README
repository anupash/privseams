This directory contains everything necessary to build HIPL on OpenWrt.

* hipl:
  The contents of this directory should be copied to the package/ subdirectory
  of an OpenWrt checkout.

* dummy_device.diff:
  This adds packaging infrastructure for the dummy network device to OpenWrt.
  The patch was applied to OpenWrt Subversion trunk as r24272, but is not
  available on the backfire release branch. Apply it to build on OpenWrt
  versions based on the backfire branch.
