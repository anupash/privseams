[TODO] 5.4.2 HIP State Processes

   See also: 8.6  Processing incoming R1 packets

     6.   If the HIP association state is I2-SENT, the system MAY reenter
          state I1-SENT and process the received R1 if it has a larger R1
          generation counter than the R1 responded to previously.

   See also: 8.7 Processing incoming I2 packets

    4. If the system is in any other state, it SHOULD check that the
       birthday value in I2 is larger than the currently stored peer
       birthday value, if there is a stored value. If the newly
       received I2 has a lower or equal birthday value than the stored
       one, the I2 is stale (perhaps replayed) and SHOULD be dropped.

    20. Upon transitioning to R2-SENT, start a timer.  Leave R2-SENT if
        either the timer expires (allowing for maximal retransmission of
        I2s), some data has been received on the incoming SA, or an
        UPDATE packet has been received (or some other packet that
        indicates that the peer has moved to ESTABLISHED).

  UNASSOCIATED
  Receive I2, process
        if successful, send R2 and go to *R2-SENT*
        if fail, stay at UNASSOCIATED
  Receive ESP for unknown SA, optionally send ICMP..
  Receive ANYOTHER, drop and stay at UNASSOCIATED

  I1-SENT
  Receive I2, process
        if successful, send R2 and go to *R2-SENT*
        if fail, stay at I1-SENT

  I2-SENT
  Receive R1, process
        if successful, send I2 and cycle at I2-SENT
        if fail, stay at I2-SENT
  Receive I2, process
        if successful, send R2 and go to *R2-SENT*
        if fail, stay at I2-SENT

  R2-SENT
  Receive I1, send R1 and stay at R2-SENT
  Receive I2, process

[DONE] 6.2.3 SPI

  Renamed from SPI to SPI_LSI. Fields "reserved" and "LSI" removed.

[DONE/NOT_IN_USE] 6.2.4 R1_COUNTER

   R1_COUNTER is now its own TLV and is separated
   from  puzzle. It was previously called BIRTHDAY.

   The R1_COUNTER parameter is optional.  It SHOULD be included in the
   R1 (in which case it is covered by the signature), and if present in
   the R1, it MAY be echoed (including the Reserved field) by the
   Initiator in the I2.

 ** have to be able to sign/recreate all R1s after the generation changes.
 ** Currently, impossible.

[DONE] 6.2.5 PUZZLE

   New opaque field that must be included by the responder. The Opaque and
   Random #I field are not covered by the HIP_SIGNATURE_2 parameter.

   Check the sending and receiving side.

[DONE] 6.2.7 DIFFIE_HELLMAN

  New 384-bit group (1). Add it from the appendix.

[DONE] 6.2.10 HOST_ID

  Format has changed (DI-type, DI-length, FQDN, Domain Identifier).

  Add the different DI types.

  If there is no Domain Identifier, i.e. the DI-type field is zero,
  also the DI Length field is set to zero.

[DONE] 6.2.15 NES

  - R flag removed
  - update id removed (a separate parameter)

[DONE] 6.2.16 SEQ (former UPDATE_ID)

  - new TLV, separated from the NES

[DONE] 6.2.17  ACK

  - new TLV, response to SEQ

[DONE] 6.2.18 ENCRYPTED

  - check changes?
  - similar to the -09

[DONE] 6.2.19 NOTIFY

   - completely new
   - add types
   - sending
   - recv handling (= HIP_DEBUG/HEXDUMP)

Someone check builder function.

[DONE] 7.2 R1 - the HIP responder packet

  See also 6.2.14  HIP_SIGNATURE_2
    - signature does not include parameters after the signature tlv
    - initiator's HIT, checksum field, and the Opaque and Random #I
      fields in the PUZZLE TLV MUST be set to zero while
      computing the HIP_SIGNATURE_2 signature.

  See also 6.2.20 ECHO_REQUEST and 6.2.21 ECHO_RESPONSE (new parameters).

  - R1_COUNTER (former BIRTHDAY) is included as a separate parameter and it
    is _optional_
  - echo request/response is optional

   The random #I is not covered by the signature and must be
   zeroed during the signature calculation, allowing the sender to
   select and set the #I into a pre-computed R1 just prior sending it to
   the peer.

   The ECHO_REQUEST contains data that the sender wants to receive
   unmodified in the corresponding response packet in the ECHO_RESPONSE
   parameter.  The ECHO_REQUEST can be either covered by the signature,
   or it can be left out from it.  In the first case, the ECHO_REQUEST
   gets Type number 1022 and in the latter case 65281.

   The signature is calculated over the whole HIP envelope, after
   setting the initiator HIT, header checksum as well as the Opaque
   field and the Random #I in the PUZZLE parameter temporarily to zero.

[DONE] 7.3 I2 - the second HIP initiator packet

  See also 6.2.20 ECHO_REQUEST and 6.2.21 ECHO_RESPONSE (new parameters).

  - R1_COUNTER is included as a separate parameter and it is optional
  - signature does not include parameters after the signature tlv

[DONE] 7.4  R2 - the second HIP responder packet

  - signature does not include parameters after the signature tlv
  
[DONE] 7.5 "UPDATE" packet

  - Mika is working on this.

IETF 59 action items
====================

[DONE] Host ID
[DONE] Type constants for parameters.

IETF 58 action items
====================

[MIKA] Respect responder's Diffie-Hellman group.

[LATER] Host Identity Tag (draft-08)
Any conforming implementation MUST be able to deal with both types of
HITs.  When handling other than type 1 HITs, the implementation is
RECOMMENDED to explicitly learn and record the binding between the
Host Identifier and the HIT, as it may not be able generate such HITs
from Host Identifiers.

[DONE] 3.3 Security Parameter Index (draft-07)
The SPI selection SHOULD be random.  A different SPI SHOULD be used
for each HIP exchange with a particular host; this is to avoid a
replay attack.  Additionally, when a host rekeys, the SPI MUST change.
Furthermore, if a host changes over to use a different IP address, it
MAY change the SPI used.
-random SPI in I2 and R2

[MIKA] 3.5 TCP and UDP pseudoheader computation (draft-07)
When computing TCP and UDP checksums on sockets bound to HITs or LSIs,
the IPv6 pseudo-header format [10] is used.  Additionally, the HITs
MUST be used in the place of the IPv6 addresses in the IPv6
pseudoheader.  Note that the pseudo-header for actual HIP payloads is
computed differently; see Section 6.1.2.
-HIP payload checksum should be ok

[DONE] 4.1.1 HIP Cookie Mechanism (draft-07)
Note, however, that the implementations MUST NOT use the exact
implementation given in the appendix, and SHOULD include sufficient
randomness to the algorithm so that algorithm complexity attacks
become impossible

[MIKA] 4.1.3 HIP Birthday (draft-08)
The Birthday also has to be increased in accordance with the system's
SA timeout parameter. If the system has open SAs, it MUST increase its
Birthday.
-"open SAs"=? When building R1 birthday is set automatically

[LATER] 4.2 Sending data on HIP packets (draft-08)
- The OPTIONAL PAYLOAD packet (see Section 7.8) MAY be used to transfer
  data.

[DONE] 4.3 Rekey (draft-08)
- All conforming HIP implementations MUST support rekeying.

[LATER] 5.1 HIP Scenarios (draft-08)
- Verify this.

[DONE] 5.4.1 HIP States (draft-08)
- E4 HIP SA established, rekeying
- without NES

[DONE] 5.4.2 HIP State Processes (draft-08)
E0, E2: retransmissions
E3: Receive R1, process with SA and Birthday check
 if successful, send I2 with last datagram, drop old SA if successful,
 send I2, prepare to drop old SA and cycle at E3
E4: add this state WITHOUT NES

[DONE] 5.3 Reboot and SA timeout restart of HIP (draft-07)
If a host reboots or times out, it has lost its HIP state.  If the
system that lost state has a datagram to deliver to its peer, it
simply restarts the HIP exchange.  The peer sends an R1 HIP packet,
but does not reset its state until it receives the I2 HIP packet.  The
I2 packet MUST have a Birthday greater than the current SA's
-birthday is checked but it is ignored

The system receiving the R1 packet first checks to see if it has an
established and recently used SA with the party sending the R1. If
such an SA exists, the system checks the Birthday, if the Birthday is
greater than the current SA's Birthday, it processes the R1 packet and
resends the ESP packet (along with or) after the I2 packet.  The peer
system processes the I2 in the normal manner, and replies with an R2.
This will reestablish state between the two peers.

[DONE] 6.2 HIP parameters (draft-08)
- Lengths have been changed, check the header files. Validate lengths.

[DONE] 6.2.1 TLV format (draft-08)

[LATER] 7. HIP Packets (draft-07)
An OPTIONAL upper layer payload MAY follow the HIP header. The payload
proto field in the header indicates if there is additional data
following the HIP header. The P-bit in the control field of the HIP
packet header indicates whether the sender is capable of sending and
receiving this additional data.

- Support for more than two HIs is RECOMMENDED.


diff 08-pre-Oct01 08:

[DONE] 3.3 Security Parameter Index (SPI)

- The SPI selection SHOULD be random; the rules of Section 2.1 of the
ESP specification [15] must be followed.

6.2 HIP parameters
- Any added padding bytes MUST be set zero by the sender, but their
content SHOULD NOT be checked on the receiving end.

6.2.6 HIP_TRANSFORM
- There MUST NOT be more than six (6) HIP Suite-IDs

6.2.11 HMAC
- 160 low order bits of the HMAC computed over the HIP packet,
excluding the HMAC parameter and any following HIP_SIGNATURE or
HIP_SIGNATURE2 parameters.  The checksum field MUST be set to zero and
the HIP header length in the HIP common header MUST be calculated not
to cover any excluded parameters when the HMAC is calculated.
- HMAC calculation and verification process

6.2.12 HIP_SIGNATURE
- the signature is calculated over the HIP packet, excluding the
HIP_SIGNATURE TLV field, but including the HMAC field, if present. The
checksum field MUST be set to zero and the HIP header length in the
HIP common header MUST be calculated to the beginning of the
HIP_SIGNATURE TLV when the signature is calculated.


6.2.13 HIP_SIGNATURE_2
- the signature is calculated over the R1 packet, excluding the
HIP_SIGNATURE_2 TLV field, but including the HMAC field, if
present. Initiator's HIT and Checksum field MUST be set to zero and
the HIP packet length in the HIP header MUST be calculated to the
beginning of the HIP_SIGNATURE_2 TLV when the signature is calculated.
- NES ID Initialized to zero and incremented for each NES.

6.2.15 ENCRYPTED
- see the whole section

7.5 NES - the HIP New SPI Packet
- It also contains a NES ID and HMAC to provide DoS and replay
protection.  Each system must have a NES ID counter, initialized to
zero and incremented on each NES.

8.3.2 Processing incoming ICMP Protocol Unreachable messages
- currently received, but not handled

8.5 Processing incoming R1 packets
- 14.  The system initialized the remaining variables in the
associated state, including NES ID counters.

8.6 Processing incoming I2 packets
- 18.  The system initialized the remaining variables in the
associated state, including NES ID counters.

8.8 Initiating rekeying
- 3.  The system creates a NES packet, which SHOULD contain a
Diffie-Hellman parameter.  If the NES packet contains the
Diffie-Hellman parameter, the Keymat Index in the NES_INFO parameter
MUST be zero.

8.9 Processing NES packets
- 4.  If the received NES contains a Diffie-Hellman parameter, the
received Keymat Index MUST zero.  If this test fails, the packet
SHOULD be dropped and the system SHOULD log an error message.

8.9.1 Processing an initial NES packet
- 3. If the system generated new KEYMAT in the previous step, it sets
Keymat Index to zero, independent on whether the received NES included
a Diffie-Hellman key or not.

8.9.2 Processing a reply NES packet
- 2.  If the system generated new KEYMAT in the previous step, it sets
Keymat Index to zero, independent on whether the received NES included
a Diffie-Hellman key or not.
- 5.  If the system has no data to send for 500ms, it SHOULD send an
ESP packet anyway.  The purpose of this packet is to acknowledge the
other party that the NES reply came through, and to allow the other
party to switch over to the new outgoing SA.  It is RECOMMENDED that
the system sends an empty ESP packet, i.e., one where the Next Header
field is IPPROTO_NONE (decimal 59).

11. ESP with HIP
- see chapter

11.1 Security Association Management
- REMOVED: The SA MUST include the random # I that was used when the
SA was created.  It is used for replay protection.

  * hip.c: if null-cipher registration fails, ignore?
  * check that the kernel builds with hipmod disabled
  * IPv4 support
  * handoff
    * return routability (unspecified)
    * fine tuning (ifconfig add del etc.)
    * problem: two hosts (A, B) in the same LAN and A changes LAN => B
      probably still sends packets to wrong link address
    * answer: when a REA is received, *something* must be deallocated
     * from Sep 24: REA with 0 addresses means "delete all addresses which has this Interface ID".
       This is not in specifications, but we test this to see if it is usable workaround fix.
  * handle special and error situations in the kernel
  * check lockings in the kernel
  * #includes
    * problem when #including ip.h
    * check content of include files and file locations, reorganize ?
  * test/conntest-server-hip
  * use errno.h everywhere (do not use sysexits ?)
  * typedef sockaddr_in6 = hit (research problem)
  * snapshot patches to web (against the base kernel)
  * javadoc like C-based documentation ?
   * DocBook is used currently
  * HIP related #defines not beginning with HIP to HIP_..
  * hip module should really depend on other modules (make config, Config.in)
  * change Host Identity -> Host Identifier in source code (arch
    draft chapter 3)
  * db.c: locking issues = add to function's comment block: "if this
    function uses some database, tell if it does the locking by itself
    or does the caller need to hold the lock before calling this
    function"
  * fixed size arrays -> change to use struct list_head
  * common functions/macros for variables of type struct list_head
  * status page: collect all MUST/SHOULD/etc from drafts and see if we comply to the drafts

*** Moved linux/net/ipv6/hip/*.c header TODO items here ****

 * input.c TODO:
 * - hip_inbound: the state should be changed in hip_inbound, not in the
 *   functions that are called from hip_inbound!
 * - If a function returns a value, we MUST NOT ignore it
 * - hip_handle_i2_finish_sig, hip_handle_r2_finish: check return values of
 *   hip_setup_ipsec
 * - make null-cipher optional, so that the module can be loaded without it
 * - decrypt encrypted field in handle_i2
 * - check buffer overflow (ctx->htpr) issues in building of R1
 * - convert building of r1 to use only builder functions
 * - later on everything should be built/parsed using builder
 * - No hip packets should be sent or received before autosetup
 *   is finished:
 *     if (hipd_get_auto_setup_state() != HIPD_AUTO_SETUP_STATE_FINISHED)
 *       fail_somehow();
 * - verify signatures in base exchange handlers
 * - separate the tlv checking code into an own function from handle_r1?
 * - LOCKING TO REA
 * - AC/ACR: more accurate RTT timing than jiffies ?
 * - cancel sent rea timer when ACR is received
 *
 * BUGS:
 * - possible kernel panic if module is rmmod'd and REA timer
 *   expires after that
 * - It should be signalled somehow when building of R1 is 100 %
 *   complete. Otherwise an incomplete packet could be sent for
 *   the initiator?
 * - handle_i2 trusts the source HIT in the received I2 packet: DoS?
 * - the functions in this file probably leak memory (skbs?)
 *

 * output.c TODO:
 * - If a function returns a value, we MUST NOT ignore it
 * - make null-cipher optional, so that the module can be loaded without it
 * - timeouts to cookies
 * - LOCKING TO REA/AC sent lists
 * - AC/ACR: more accurate RTT timing than jiffies ?
 * - hip_send_rea_all: test with multiple REA_INFO payloads (mm-00 sec 6.1.1)
 * - document hip_getfrag using docbook
 * - rename hip_rea_delete_sent_list_one -> hip_rea_delete_sent_list
 * - remove duplicate code, REA/AC list
 * - adding of HMAC/signature to the packet: own functions
 *
 * BUGS:
 * - It should be signalled somehow when building of R1 is 100 % 
 *   complete. Otherwise an incomplete packet could be sent for
 *   the initiator?
 *

 * builder.c TODO:
 * - add validation functions for host_id, host_id_eid
 * - move hip_builder.h to this dir
 * - a separate function for accessing parameters with same id (i.e. you
 *   give the "current" point of searching in the message)
 * - consider embbedding hip_tlv_common in all parameter structs in hip.h?
 * - alignment
 *   - Building of generic parameter should be done using array copy instead
 *     of memcpy()? Memcpy might involve some performance penalties when
 *     trying to read/write unaligned data.
 *   - should we have a get_sizeof_param(param_type) function instead
 *     of just relying on packed structures?
 * - consider supporting vararg for build_param()?
 *   - this complicates things too much.. especially in parsing
 * - unit tests for builder.c
 * - set the version number to something bizarre in hip daemon header builder
 *   so that e.g. dumper can tell the difference between daemon and network
 *   headers
 * - hip_dump_msg() should display also network headers
 * - uncomment commented assertions and test them
 * - Can {daemon|network} header be built before other headers?
 * - fix: get/set msg type err network byte order
 * - a new header for hipd messages? hip_daemon_msg etc.
 * - some of the builder functions could be named better
 *

 * db.c TODO:
 * - change all of these functions to static
 * - sdb accessors and locking
 *   - all accessors should use get_first and get_next functions
 *   - each sdb state can have its own lock and the get_first/get_next
 *     functions use that lock
 * - host id accessors and locking
 *   - use the lock macro!
 *   - use the get_first and get_next accessors, not directly!
 *
 * BUGS:
 * - hip_built_r1 has no acquire_lock


 * hip.c TODO:
 * - sdb accessors and locking
 * - hip_init and unit: check and rewrite!
 * - Mika: locks are missing from proc_xx functions
 * - add, find, del host id: modify to take care of peer addresses also
 * - lhi naming convention is used incorrectly in peer_info stuff?
 * - check network byte ordering in hip_{add|del|get}_lhi
 * - separate the tlv checking code into an own function from handle_r1?
 * - All context->{hip_in|hip_out}->pointers are not filled. Currently
 *   this is not a problem, but may cause bugs later?
 * - locking to hip_proc_read_lhi and others
 * - EEXIST -> ENOMSG ?
 * - hip_inet6addr_event_handler and hip_netdev_event_handler
 *   share a lot of same looking code
 */

 * socket.c Todo:
 * - Do we need separate proto ops for dgrams?
 * - What functions should return just zero?
 *

 * unit.c TODO:
 * - Space, suite and case structures are somewhat the same; this could
 *   better exploited by combining the several almost-the-same-copy-paste
 *   functions into one, signle function.
