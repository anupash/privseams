This file contains some of the things to do for the
implementation. The rest of the TODO items are scattered in source
files: mainly as a list in the beginning of the source file.
Sometimes the items are as notes elsewhere in the source file if the
there is specific line of the source code that needs fixing. Search
for the strings "XX" or "TODO" to locate the file specific TODO items.


IETF 63 action items
====================

Base draft (diff 02,03):

  - all parameter values changed (section 6.2)
  - parameter type order strictly enforced, except for 2048-4095 (6.2)
  - HIT computation has changed -- now they are 120 bits (section 3)
  - state machine 4.4.2:
    - state machine changed; there are two instances where you need to
      compare HITs, etc (Aura et al)
    - CLOSE handling
  - nonce I and J should hashed into the DH keymaterial
  - does not affect interops (?): puzzle storing has changed (see section C)
  - the HI in I2 can be unencrypted
  - notify has changed
  - XX FIX: check interoperability between user and kernel branches

ESP-draft:

  - SPI is gone, replaced with ESP_INFO

MM-draft (diff 01,02):

  - SPI and NES are gone, replaced with ESP_INFO
  - REA is now LOCATOR
  - keymat_index is now always explicitly specified
  - an ACK can now be a multi-ACK, containing multiple sequence numbers!

Rendezvous draft:
  - XX CHECK

[TODO] 5.4.2 HIP State Processes

   See also: 8.6  Processing incoming R1 packets

     6.   If the HIP association state is I2-SENT, the system MAY reenter
          state I1-SENT and process the received R1 if it has a larger R1
          generation counter than the R1 responded to previously.

   See also: 8.7 Processing incoming I2 packets

    4. If the system is in any other state, it SHOULD check that the
       birthday value in I2 is larger than the currently stored peer
       birthday value, if there is a stored value. If the newly
       received I2 has a lower or equal birthday value than the stored
       one, the I2 is stale (perhaps replayed) and SHOULD be dropped.

    20. Upon transitioning to R2-SENT, start a timer.  Leave R2-SENT if
        either the timer expires (allowing for maximal retransmission of
        I2s), some data has been received on the incoming SA, or an
        UPDATE packet has been received (or some other packet that
        indicates that the peer has moved to ESTABLISHED).

  UNASSOCIATED
  Receive I2, process
        if successful, send R2 and go to *R2-SENT*
        if fail, stay at UNASSOCIATED
  Receive ESP for unknown SA, optionally send ICMP..
  Receive ANYOTHER, drop and stay at UNASSOCIATED

  I1-SENT
  Receive I2, process
        if successful, send R2 and go to *R2-SENT*
        if fail, stay at I1-SENT

  I2-SENT
  Receive R1, process
        if successful, send I2 and cycle at I2-SENT
        if fail, stay at I2-SENT
  Receive I2, process
        if successful, send R2 and go to *R2-SENT*
        if fail, stay at I2-SENT

  R2-SENT
  Receive I1, send R1 and stay at R2-SENT
  Receive I2, process
    if failed, stay at R2-SENT
  Receive UPDATE (check)

  Move to ESTABLISHED after an implementation specific time.

  ESTABLISHED -> check

  REKEYING <- check

[DONE/NOT_IN_USE] 6.2.4 R1_COUNTER

   R1_COUNTER is now its own TLV and is separated
   from  puzzle. It was previously called BIRTHDAY.

   The R1_COUNTER parameter is optional.  It SHOULD be included in the
   R1 (in which case it is covered by the signature), and if present in
   the R1, it MAY be echoed (including the Reserved field) by the
   Initiator in the I2.

 ** have to be able to sign/recreate all R1s after the generation changes.
 ** Currently, impossible.

IETF 58 action items
====================

[MIKA] Respect responder's Diffie-Hellman group.

[LATER] Host Identity Tag (draft-08)
Any conforming implementation MUST be able to deal with both types of
HITs.  When handling other than type 1 HITs, the implementation is
RECOMMENDED to explicitly learn and record the binding between the
Host Identifier and the HIT, as it may not be able generate such HITs
from Host Identifiers.

[MIKA/DONE ?] 3.5 TCP and UDP pseudoheader computation (draft-07)
When computing TCP and UDP checksums on sockets bound to HITs or LSIs,
the IPv6 pseudo-header format [10] is used.  Additionally, the HITs
MUST be used in the place of the IPv6 addresses in the IPv6
pseudoheader.  Note that the pseudo-header for actual HIP payloads is
computed differently; see Section 6.1.2.
-HIP payload checksum should be ok

[MIKA] 4.1.3 HIP Birthday (draft-08)
The Birthday also has to be increased in accordance with the system's
SA timeout parameter. If the system has open SAs, it MUST increase its
Birthday.
-"open SAs"=? When building R1 birthday is set automatically

[LATER] 4.2 Sending data on HIP packets (draft-08)
- The OPTIONAL PAYLOAD packet (see Section 7.8) MAY be used to transfer
  data.

[LATER] 5.1 HIP Scenarios (draft-08)
- Verify this.

[LATER] 7. HIP Packets (draft-07)
An OPTIONAL upper layer payload MAY follow the HIP header. The payload
proto field in the header indicates if there is additional data
following the HIP header. The P-bit in the control field of the HIP
packet header indicates whether the sender is capable of sending and
receiving this additional data.

[LATER] 7.7 CER - the HIP Certificate Packet (draft-08)
- The CER packet is OPTIONAL.

[LATER] 7.8 PAYLOAD - the HIP Payload Packet (draft-08)
- The PAYLOAD packet is OPTIONAL.

[LATER] 8. Packet processing (draft-08)
- this is a totally new chapter

[LATER] 12. HIP Policies (draft-07)
- All HIP implementations MUST support more than one simultaneous HIs,
  at least one one of which SHOULD be reserved for anonymous usage
- Support for more than two HIs is RECOMMENDED.


diff 08-pre-Oct01 08:

6.2 HIP parameters
- Any added padding bytes MUST be set zero by the sender, but their
content SHOULD NOT be checked on the receiving end.

6.2.11 HMAC
- 160 low order bits of the HMAC computed over the HIP packet,
excluding the HMAC parameter and any following HIP_SIGNATURE or
HIP_SIGNATURE2 parameters.  The checksum field MUST be set to zero and
the HIP header length in the HIP common header MUST be calculated not
to cover any excluded parameters when the HMAC is calculated.
- HMAC calculation and verification process

6.2.12 HIP_SIGNATURE
- the signature is calculated over the HIP packet, excluding the
HIP_SIGNATURE TLV field, but including the HMAC field, if present. The
checksum field MUST be set to zero and the HIP header length in the
HIP common header MUST be calculated to the beginning of the
HIP_SIGNATURE TLV when the signature is calculated.

6.2.13 HIP_SIGNATURE_2
- the signature is calculated over the R1 packet, excluding the
HIP_SIGNATURE_2 TLV field, but including the HMAC field, if
present. Initiator's HIT and Checksum field MUST be set to zero and
the HIP packet length in the HIP header MUST be calculated to the
beginning of the HIP_SIGNATURE_2 TLV when the signature is calculated.
- NES ID Initialized to zero and incremented for each NES.

6.2.15 ENCRYPTED
- see the whole section

8.3.2 Processing incoming ICMP Protocol Unreachable messages
- currently received, but not handled (except debugging)

8.5 Processing incoming R1 packets
- 14.  The system initialized the remaining variables in the
associated state, including NES ID counters.

8.6 Processing incoming I2 packets
- 18.  The system initialized the remaining variables in the
associated state, including NES ID counters.

11.1 Security Association Management
- REMOVED: The SA MUST include the random # I that was used when the
SA was created.  It is used for replay protection.

Started connest-server on remote machine. Then conntest-gai-client on local 
machine. Then:

$ ifconfig eth0 del 3ffe::2/64
$ ifconfig eth0 add 3ffe::3/64

Sometimes I did not even get to enter the 2nd line before the machine died.

libinet6 requires tools to be built before it.

Solution: a global configure/make system.

Bug: hip_socket->sk does not have locks.
Solution: add a semaphore or spinlock to hip_socket->sk.

During IETF, Thomas said that birthday count is quite huge. It should
be incremental from zero?

   - regular: no, because ip6_*put.c will not compile if HIP is not to be compiled

    - functionality:
      - only when:
        not(transparency=off and AI_HIP=off) and node=dns_name
      - open and read /etc/hip/hosts, grep node name (=dns_name)
      - get HIT from the grep'd line and corresponding IP for the HIT by
        grepping HIT's fqdn from /etc/hosts (in libinet6 addresses are fetched
        transparently from /etc/hosts)

 * - separate the tlv checking code into an own function from handle_r1?
 *

 * - consider embbedding hip_tlv_common in all parameter structs in hip.h?
 * - alignment
 *   - Building of generic parameter should be done using array copy instead
