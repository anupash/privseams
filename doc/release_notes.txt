Interoperability Status
=======================

We interoperated during IETF62 with Boeing and Ericsson. The base
exchange was successfully interoperated with RSA and AES. We tried
also RSA-to-DSA base exchange, and it worked too.

Interoperating of the mobility and multihoming extensions was only
partially successful. This release does not interoperate with Ericsson
and Boeing.

Test Platform and Environment
=============================

The release was validated using the following configuration:

Initiator:
* Intel Pentium M 1.60 GHz laptop (IBM R51) with 2048 KB cache
* 1 GB of memory
* Debian Sarge
* 1 network interface
  - eth0: 3ffe::1

Responder:
* Intel Pentium III 700 Mhz laptop (HP Omnibook 500), L2 cache 256 KB
* 512  MB of memory
* Fedora Core 3
* 2 network interfaces
  - eth0: 3ffe::2, connected with a cable to the switch
  - eth1: initially down, no cable

The hosts were connected a LAN through a switch. The responder had two
network interfaces but only one of them was connected at time using a
single network cable.

Test Scenarios
==============

Compilation of HIPL was successful on both Debian and FC3. See the
doc/HOWTO for instructions for compilation instructions and how to
set-up the environment for HIP. Below you find the commands we used
for testing this release (against itself):

Base Exchange:
  responder % tools/hipsetup -r
  initiator % tools/hipsetup -i responder-hit

The mobility and handover tests were run so that the network setup on
the responder was reset after each test case.

Mobility with Soft Handover:
  responder % nc6 -l -p 12345
  initiator % hipconf add map responder-hit 3ffe::2
  initiator % nc6 responder-hit 12345
  initiator % <type some text on the nc6>
  responder % ifconfig eth1 up
  responder % ip addr add 3ffe::3/64 dev eth0
  responder % ip addr del 3ffe::2/64 dev eth0
  responder % <type some text on the nc6>

Mobility with Hard Handover:
  responder % nc6 -l -p 12345
  initiator % hipconf add map responder-hit 3ffe::2
  initiator % nc6 responder-hit 12345
  initiator % <type some text on the nc6>
  responder % ifconfig eth1 up
  responder % ip addr del 3ffe::2/64 dev eth0
  responder % ip addr add 3ffe::3/64 dev eth0
  responder % <type some text on the nc6>

Multihoming with Soft Handover:
  responder % nc6 -l -p 12345
  initiator % hipconf add map responder-hit 3ffe::2
  initiator % nc6 responder-hit 12345
  initiator % <type some text on the nc6>
  responder % ifconfig eth1 up
  responder % ip addr add 3ffe::3/64 dev eth1
  responder % ifconfig eth0 down
  responder % <type some text on the nc6>

Multihoming with Hard Handover:
  responder % nc6 -l -p 12345
  initiator % hipconf add map responder-hit 3ffe::2
  initiator % nc6 responder-hit 12345
  initiator % <type some text on the nc6>
  responder % ifconfig eth0 down
  responder % ifconfig eth1 up
  responder % ip addr add 3ffe::3/64 dev eth1
  responder % <type some text on the nc6>

Initially the base exchange did not succeed because the responder got
"destination unreachable" ICMPv6. I guess this was related on how the
routing was set-up. Mobility and multihoming tests failed couple of
times because the tester forgot to change the cable in incorrect
sequence (and we don't have retransmissions implemented).

As summary, both the base exchange and m&m extensions tests for this
release were passed.
