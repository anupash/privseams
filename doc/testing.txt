- performance
  - crypto
    - on / off
    - varying keylengths
  - cookies
    - varying k values
  - resolver
    - manual keying or from DNS
  - the effect of the network 
    - packet transfer latency included / excluded
    - performance time with HIP and without HIP
    - fragmentation
    - wlan
    - hand-over
  - meters   
    - measure the performance of subcomponents to find the bottlenecks
      - coarse grained: packets I1, I2, jne.
      - fine grained: operations (signing, verifying)
    - stress tests: several simultaneous base exchanges
    - system load
    - comparisons between ..
      - different implementations
      - different protocols (e.g. MobileIP)
    - run the tests in ... level
      - userspace
      - transport
      - ip
  - math and graphs
    - variance
    - averages
    - graphs
    - tests have to be run several times!
  - tools
    - own set of tools
    - netperf
    - iperf
    - netpipe

- reliability
  - DoS
  - stress tests
    - multiple simultaneous base exchanges
      - tests also dead locks
  - compatibility tests
    - Ericsson, IndraNet, Boeing, (Cisco?)
  - unit-testing
    - userspace
       - daemon
       - crypto
       - libinet6
    - kernel
      - test the functions that can be tested
      - trigger testing e.g. with hipconf
    - shared code
      - packet builder
