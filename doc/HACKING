AUTOCONF AND AUTOMAKE
=====================

Autoconf and automake tools help developers to avoid from "include
header dependency hell" so they are also used by HIPL in "tools" and
"test" directories. Standard linux kernel supports only plain old
Makefiles, so "linux" subdirectory is not controlled with
autoconf/automake. The "doc" directory uses plain old Makefile because
it uses the same documentation building system as "linux". Libinet6
has been imported from the Usagi project and uses only automake (no
autoconf).

If you need to add or remove source/header files or modify build
rules, edit "Makefile.am". If you need to modify dependencies, edit
"configure.ac". After editing the files, run "autoreconf". Autoreconf
may then update some files (config.h.in, config.sub, configure,
Makefile, Makefile.in) and you need to commit them too into the CVS
along with your new source and header files.

If you need to share a file between userspace and kernelspace, place
it in the kernelspace and modify userspace Makefile.am to create a
link to it from userspace (CVS does not accept links). For example,
"tools/Makefile.am" makes a local link to
"hipl/linux/net/ipv6/builder.c" by the following rule:

	builder.c:
        	$(LN_S) ../linux/net/ipv6/hip/builder.c .

CODING CONVENTIONS
==================

- Don't invent your own coding style. It will give the code an
  ununified look. Especially, if you don't follow the memory deallocation
  procedure below, you might even cause some memory leaks.

- All code should follow the standard linux coding conventions
  listed in <linux_root>/Documentation/CodingStyle. Particularly,
  the indenting is eight spaces.

- All code shared between userspace and kernel should follow kernel
  coding style.

- In emacs, you can set the Linux kernel indendation as default by adding
  the following lines to your ".emacs" file located at your home directory:

    (defun my-c-mode-common-hook ()
      (c-set-style "linux"))
    (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-mode-common-hook)
    (global-set-key [f5] 'indent-region)

  Now, whenever you wish to indend a region,

    1. Move the cursor to the beginning of the region to be indended and press
       CTRL & SPACE (first control, hold it down and press space.)
    2. Move the cursor to the end of the region to be indended, and press F5.   

- HIPL code should use the prefix "hip_" in all function and global variable
  definitions to avoid namespace pollution, especially in the
  libraries. The prefix is not necessary in userspace code, but the same
  naming conventions might be clearer to use anyway.

- The width of one line should be limited to 80 characters in
  userspace code. This rule may be relaxed in the kernel code because
  the space is very limited due to the 8 character indentation.

- All functions should return an error value instead of "ok" value. That, is
  zero for success and non-zero for failure.

- Use the HIP_IFE, HIP_IFEL macros to reduce the number of lines of code.

- Do not make unreadable code by nesting code too much:

  if (foo) {
     if (bar) {
        if(hello)
        {
           confuse_me();
        }
     }
  }

  Instead, join the conditional expressions (foo && bar && hello) or
  use goto (goto skip;).

- Declare variables right after beginning brace, not in the middle of the code:

  int foo {
    int i;  /* integers declared in the beginning of the function */
    char c;

    bar();

    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
       int x; /* This is fine because it is after the beginning
                 brace of loop */
       hello(i, x);
    }
  }

  hipsock shares code with the rest of the code and it requires ISO C90
  style C code. Declare variables right after braces!

- Memory (de)allocation procedure is as follows:
 
	int f() {
		char *mem = NULL;
		HIP_IFEL(!(mem = HIP_ALLOC(256, 0)), -1, "alloc\n");

	  out_err:
		if (mem)
			free(mem);
		return err;
	}

QUICK-AND-DIRTY ARCH INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEVELOPERS
================================================

These instructions assume that you want to access the HIPL source code
using ssh. Note: tla and bazaar provide the same functionality but
bazaar was faster and more user friendly when this was written.

# Register an account:
#
baz register-archive hipl-dev@freelists.org--hipl \
       sftp://mkomu@hipl.hiit.fi/var/archive/hipl
baz my-default-archive hipl-dev@freelists.org--hipl

# Get a working copy from the main branch:
#
baz get hipl--main--2.6 hipl--main--2.6

# Copy the tla hook if you want to get your commit logs to the mailing list:
#
cp hipl--main--2.6/test/tla-hook ~/.arch-params/hook

# Different ways to commit code:
#
a) baz commit # Open's your default editor and commits.
b) emacs `tla make-log`; tla commit
c) baz commit -s "Explanation jaada jaada"

# How to check what your have modified in the tree
#
baz changes

# How to make a branch from the current version of the main branch
#
baz my-default archive # Make sure that you are accessing the HIPL archive
baz archive-setup hipl--mybranch--2.6
baz tag hipl--main--2.6 hipl--mybranch--2.6

# Get the new branch
#
baz get hipl--mybranch--2.6 hipl--mybranch--2.6

# How to synchronize branches... remember to make clean commits, i.e. do
# NOT commit a merge and local modifications in the same commit!
#
cd hipl--mybranch--2.6
baz changes # Check that the tree is unmodified
baz star-merge hipl--main--2.6

--- Optional ---

Below are some instructions on using revision libraries. They speed-up
tla/baz operations.

# Make a revision library (otherwise e.g. commit and changes take up to
# 15 mins!)
#
mkdir ~/.tla-rev-lib
baz my-revision-library ~/.tla-rev-lib/
baz library-config --greedy --sparse ~/.tla-rev-lib/

# Get a working copy from the main branch using revision libraries:
#
baz get --link hipl--main--2.6 hipl--main--2.6

Also, the tla usage is optimized using hard-linked revision
libraries.

# Run the command below in your working copy (e.g. monthly) if you
# experience a serious slow-down in the commit speed or you want to enable
# revision libraries in your local copy:
#
cd hipl--main--2.6
baz changes --link

ARCH POLICY
===========

*** Important: see that your umask is 0002 before you make any commits ***

hipl--main--2.6 is the "stable" branch for HIPL code. Do not put any
experimental code in there because other people are relying on that
the code works! Commit only minor bugfixes directly to the stable
branch, and use/create other branches to develop experimental
code. When you have tested and are sure that code works, you can merge
it into the stable branch.

Some points in the branch quality assurance:

- the code must compile as it is without errors
- compiler warning messages must be taken seriously and must not be ignored
  unless you really know what the message means. And we REALLY mean really.
- the base exchange should be manually tested between two hosts
- UPDATE packet exchange should work
- the code should not leak memory or do bad locking
- (all existing unit tests should be run without any errors (see TESTING))

RETRIEVING PACKAGES FROM A REPOSITORY
=====================================

- tools to retrieve packages are yum and apt-get

yum for Fedora
--------------

- to configure yum for Fedora modify configuration

/etc/yum.conf

[package]
name=package
baseurl=http://URL/yum/base/package
 
- create directory for package and copy rpm package 
- to directory before update repository for yum

$ sudo createrepo package

- install the HIPL package using command

$ yum install package

apt-get for Debian
------------------

- to configure apt-get for Debian modify sources.list

$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

deb http://packages.infrahip.net/ hipl-lib main
deb http://packages.infrahip.net/ hipl-core main
deb http://packages.infrahip.net/ hipl-tools main
deb http://packages.infrahip.net/ hipl-doc main
deb http://packages.infrahip.net/ hipl-agent main
deb http://packages.infrahip.net/ hipl-firewall main
deb http://packages.infrahip.net/ hipl-test main

- update and install packages 

$ sudo apt-get update 

$ sudo apt-get install hipl-lib

$ sudo apt-get install hipl-lib hipl-core hipl-tools hipl-doc

How to create hipl repository on the web server?
------------------------------------------------

- create directory tree for all packages on the web server

$sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/dists/hipl-lib/main/binary-i386

- create description files of Packages.gz for all packages

$ dpkg-scanpackages . /dev/null | gzip -9c > Packages.gz

- copy all packages and description files onto the web server

$ sudo rsync Packages.gz root@packages.infrahip.net:/var/www/html/dists/hipl-lib/main/binary-i386/

$ sudo rsync hipl-lib-1.0-3-i386.deb root@packages.infrahip.net:/var/www/html/


DEBUGGING
=========

Debugging the kernel with gdb is not possible unless you're running
User Mode Linux and in such cases you may prefer manual debugging
statements in the code. It may be also your personal favourite to
prefer debugging statements over gdb in the userspace. HIPL provides a
set of wrappers for adding debugging statements in a concise way:

- HIP_DIE(arguments as for printk)
- HIP_ERROR(arguments as for printk)
- HIP_INFO(arguments as for printk) 
- HIP_DEBUG(arguments as for printk) 

The wrappers exists for many reasons. First, it is very convinient to
have the same syntax for the debug statements indepently of whether
you degugging in kernel or userspace.

Second, an "ad hoc" debug statement mechanism would make it more
difficult to adopt HIPL into production environment because it would
be awkward to comment all the superfluous debug messages. The
superfluous debug messages can be suppressed by a single switch to
configure (CONFIG_HIP_DEBUG) if an unified interface for debugging is
used.

Third reason for the existance of wrappers is that a uniform
importancy level of debug messages can be enforced. For example, error
messages are more important than info messages and info messages are
more important than debug messages. One benefit of the importancy of
levels is that the debug messages can be cathegorized into two groups:
the ones that are always included in a build and the ones that are
included only in a development build. HIP_DEBUG belongs to the latter
group and the other functions belong to the second group.

The fourth reason for justifying the wrappers is that some programs
cannot be run interactively on the screen in production
environment. For example, the HIP daemon is preferred to be run as a
background process in production environment by the end-users. The
debug statements cannot be printed on the screen in such a case;
instead, the statements have to passed via syslog. On the other hand,
the developer wants to run the daemon interactively. The wrappers make
it possible to please both of the groups easily.

Debug statements should not be removed from code because someone may
have use for the debug statement later on. The preferred way is to put a
"_" in front of the debug function name to prevent the debug statement
to ever to be shown (indepently of whether the build is a development
or production build):

- _HIP_DIE(..)
- _HIP_ERROR(..)
- _HIP_INFO(.. 
- _HIP_DEBUG(..) 

COMMENTING AND DOCUMENTING THE CODE
===================================

Doxygen is now used for documenting HIPL. Manual for how to use doxygen
documentation, is found from here:
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual.html

To create doxygen documentation in HTML format, execute "make doxygen".
Doxygen will create documentation under doc/doxy/html.
You can view the generated documentation with
"firefox doc/doxy/html/index.html"

The aforementioned Doxygen manual has detailed instructions on how to document
the code. We go the basics through next.

First of all, Doxygen supports different commenting styles. We use the JavaDoc
style in this project. In this style, every Doxygen comment starts and ends with
constant character sequence. To start a commenting block use "\**", and to end a
commenting block use "*/". Example 1:

/** The number of items in the list. */
int count;

In example 1 we have a variable named count to which we wish to add a Doxygen
comment "The number of items in the list." As a general rule, a Doxygen comment
is bound to the next item. So if in Example 1 we would have had "int count2"
just after count, the Doxygen comment would have been bound only "int count".

If you wish to add a Doxygen comment on the same line that the variable is, you
have to to put an additional < marker in the comment block. Example 2:

int count; /**< The number of items in the list. */

This has the same effect as Example 1. Remember that the comment with the <
marker has to start from the same line as the variable. Using the special marker
< one can comment also structure members. Example 3:

/** A HIP FROM parameter. */
struct hip_from {
     hip_tlv_type_t type;  /**< Type code for the parameter. */
     hip_tlv_len_t  length; /**< Length of the parameter contents in bytes. */
     uint8_t address[16]; /**< IPv6 address */
} __attribute__ ((packed));

Here the whole structure gets Doxygen comment "A HIP FROM parameter", and the
members get commented as illustrated. The structure members can also be
commented using the plain /** ... */ comment block by placing the comment block
on the line before the member, but the < marker saves some space. This does it
for variable commenting, lets move onto function commenting. Example 4.

/**
 * Sets a type for a host association. Sets the type for a host association
 * and validates the type number. If the type number is illegal, the @c entry
 * is left untouched. 	
 * 
 * @param entry       a pointer to a host association entry. 
 * @param type_number a type number to be set for @c entry.
 * @return            zero on success, non-zero else.
 * @note              the entry must not be NULL
 * @see               hip_clear_type()
 */
int hip_set_type(hip_ha_t *entry, int type_number);

Notice how that whole commenting is just before the function block. The
function commenting block contains three elements, the brief description, the
description and the special commands starting with "@". The brief description
is the first comment line which ends at the first dot followed by a space or new
line. Thus, in example 4 the brief description is "Sets a type for a host
association." The description consists of the brief description and the rest of
the lines following the brief description before the special commands.

The special commands comment the function parameters and the return value.
Furthermore an extra note is added to this comment with "@note" and a reference
to a related function with "@see". Notice how we refer to the function
parameters in the description text with the special command "@c" Including this
special command is by no way obligatory. It only makes the next word to be
rendered using Courier instead of the default font. However, be careful not to
add your own special commands by accidentally typing something like @entry.

Function comment blocks can be placed to the c-file or the header file. You 
should prefer the header file because it saves space from the actual code file.
Doxygen comment blocks have the tendency to bloat the code. Generally, if
possible, place the doxygen comment in the header file instead of the c-file.
This applies to all Doxygen comments, not just function comments.

Doxygen includes a special tag for todo items. The todo tags is "@todo". The todo
tag can be placed anywhere in the code. When placed inside of a function, the
todo item becomes a todo item for the respective function. When placed outside
of a function, the todo item becomes a todo item for the whole file. To create
a todo item for a variable, insert a @todo inside the variable's Doxygen comment
block.

Example 5 is an example of an todo item placed inside a function, in the middle
of the code. Hence, this becomes a todo item for the whole function. Doxygen
maintains a list that contains all of the todo items of the project. Example 5.

HIP_DEBUG("outgoing UPDATE ID=%u\n", update_id_out);
/** @todo Handle this case. */
HIP_IFEL(!update_id_out, -EINVAL, "Outgoing UPDATE ID overflowed.\n");

Entire files can be commented with the "@file" special tag as illustrated in
Example 6. From example 6 we notice that Doxygen comments can also include
simple HTML.

/**
 * @file
 * This file defines various functions for handling HIP messages.
 * 
 * @author  John Doe
 * @version 1.0
 * @date    11.01.2008
 * @note    Distributed under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt">GNU/GPL</a>.
 */

Sometimes you can find yourself in a situation where you have a large number of
repetitive comments. Say that you have similar type definitions which are nicely
aligned in a header file. You could, of course, insert a normal Doxygen comment
berore (or after, using "<") every definition, but you just don't want to break
the alignment for comments sake. libinet6/protodefs.h is a good example of
that kind of file.

To help in a situation like this, the HIPL project has a special file just for
doxygen comments, i.e. it has no code whatsoever. The file is doc/doxygen.h.
We can target comments from this file to another files using the "@file" special
command. For example, to insert a Doxygen comment for the definition of 
HIP_NTF_INVALID_SYNTAX located in libinet6/protodefs.h you can add the
following, example 7.

/**
 * @file libinet6/protodefs.h
 * @def  HIP_NTF_INVALID_SYNTAX
 *       Indicates that the HIP message received was invalid because...
 */

Finally, doc/doxygen.h is a good place for declaring groups. Groups are declared
with the "@defgroup" special tag. Example 8.

/** @defgroup notification NOTIFICATION parameter values */

To add members to a group, use the "@addtogroup" special tag together with the
group name. Moreover, you need to use the special tag "@{" to start inclusion,
and the special tag "@}" to stop the inclusion. example 9 illustrates how we can
add members to the group declared in example 8.

/** @addtogroup notification
 * @{ 
 */
#define HIP_NTF_UNSUPPORTED_CRITICAL_PARAMETER_TYPE 1
#define HIP_NTF_INVALID_SYNTAX                      7
/* @} */

The general JavaDoc style guide applies to HIPL project. This style guide is
available at:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html

Remember that the normal non-Doxygen comments are always valid. Thus if you need
to comment something more specific to the code, use the regular

/* comment here. */

and

// end of line comment here.

commenting style.

SUBMITTING PATCHES
==================

HIPL is still work in progress. The code is being constantly developed
and it may be difficult to merge your contribution to the HIPL code.
If you still want to submit patches to the HIPL project, build your
patches against the main branch.  Please try the test matrix below at
least partially before you contribute.


CREATING A TARBALL OF THE SOURCE CODE
=====================================

There is a "make dist" target which builds a tarball of the hipl source   
code. It includes only the files which are necessary. The included files  
are specified in SOURCES and HEADER rules in */Makefile.am, but it is also
possible to force some extra files in top most Makefile.am.


PREBUILT BINARY PACKAGES
========================

Redhat
------

Note well: Currently the status of the packaging scripts is in very initial
phase. They are not tested throughly.

Two separate packages are planned to be provided by HIPL: one for user
space software and the other for kernel and kernel modules. Currently only
scripts for building user space packages exist.


There are scripts in directory test/packaging that can be used to create
binary packages. The aim for these packages is for easier testing of HIPL
software. With the scripts, RPM (e.g. for Fedora Core) and DEB (for Debian)
packages can be created. 

To create the RPM package, type: "./autogen && ./configure && make rpm".
This will create a source package (in tar.gz form in the same
directory) which will be used when building the RPM file. After the
script has run successfully, follow the instructions given by the
script. That is, login as root and copy the source package (e.g.
hipl-userspace-1.0-1.tgz) to directory /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES. Then
issue the command "rpmbuild -ba
<hiplroot>/test/packaging/hiplx.spec".  When everyting
is finished successfully, there will be a binary RPM package
"/usr/src/rpm/RPMS/i386/hipl-userspace-1.0-1.i386.rpm". The package
can then be installed with rpm -i.

For more info about rpm packaging, please see:

http://www.redhat.com/docs/books/max-rpm/max-rpm-html/index.html
http://fedoranews.org/tchung/htmldoc/htmldoc.spec
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging/Guidelines

Debian
------

DEB package is created similarly: "./autogen && ./configure && make
deb".
The result is both binary and source debian packages:
- Binary
Binary Debian package can be found in test/packaging/ directory
with the following name: hipl-1.0-1_i386.deb.
The package can be installed using dpkg, e.g. "dpkg -i
hipl-1.0-1_i386.deb".
- Source
Debian source package is made of three files which are:

	hipl-1.0.diff.gz
	hipl-1.0.dsc
	hipl-1.0.orig.tar.gz

and can be found under directory test/packaging/hipl-1.0-deb-src/


HOW TO CREATE KERNEL PACKAGES
=============================

Debian/Ubuntu
-------------

To create the package from vanilla sources for Debian distribution
or any distributions based on Debian (e.g. Ubuntu Dapper Drake),
follow the following instructions.

* Download and extract the vanilla kernel source (I got it from
(ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6)
I extract it to /usr/src and I added my username to src group
by typing adduser my_username src
* cd linux-2.6.xx
* Patch the kernel with the hip patches you can find under hipl/patches directory
* cp /boot/config-something .config

In order to build the binary package type the following:
* fakeroot make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=.hipl --revision=custom.1.0 kernel_image

Instead, if you would like to produces  a  debianised  package  of  the  Linux kernel sources type the following:
* fakeroot make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=.hipl --revision=custom.1.0 kernel_source kernel_headers

After the kernel has been successfully compiled, you will find the
debian packages in the top directory.

To install it type:
dpkg -i kernel-image-2.6.16.5.hipl_1.0_i386.deb
and reboot. The debian package should already include the new 
installed kernel for grub.
If you need grub check this:
http://newbiedoc.sourceforge.net/system/kernel-pkg.html#GRUB-KERNEL-PKG

Main reference (.)
http://newbiedoc.sourceforge.net/system/kernel-pkg.html


Redhat notes
------------

The instructions below did not work anymore. Instead, I followed these
instructions:

http://grid-it.cnaf.infn.it/index.php?rpmbuild&type=1
see: test/packaging/kernel-2.6.17.14.spec 

To create the package from vanilla sources (preferred method) for
Fedora, follow the instructions of this document:

http://www.openvps.org/Plone/docs/developer/kernelrpm
http://www.fedoraforum.org/forum/archive/index.php/t-28290.html

In short:
* download and extract kernel sources
* cd linux-2.6.xx
* apply hip patches
* cp /boot/config-something .config
* make rpm # or bin-rpm??

To install, do this:
* rpm -i /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/kernel-2.6.xx.rpm
* /sbin/new-kernel-pkg --mkinitrd --depmod --install --make-default 2.6.xx

NEW-KERNEL-PKG IS NECESSARY AS THE RPM DOES NOT INCLUDE INITRD AND
THE KERNEL IS NOT INCLUDED IN GRUB CONFIGURATION.

That will create and install vanilla rpm. However, if you want to use
the Fedora/Redhat patches to improve e.g. hardware support, use the
instructions below.

To create rpm for Fedora patched kernel, you need to download the
kernel from somewhere from here:

  http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/updates/

For RH/Enterprise, you need to have an account on rhn.redhat.com to
get the latest packages. Browse/and search the channels list.

I basically followed these instructions:

  http://tqmcube.com/fc3_custom_kernel.htm

This is what I did:

  * rpm -ivh kernel-2.6.10-1.760_FC3.src.rpm
  * I modified /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/kernel-2.6.spec to include the HIP
    patches:

     %define rhbsys .beet

     # HIPL patches
     Patch190: simple-beet-ph-patch-v1.0-2.6.16.5
     Patch191: interfamily-beet-ph-patch-v1.0-2.6.16.5
     Patch192: policy-sleep-2.6.16.5-v2.patch
     Patch193: hipmod-2.6.16.5-v1.patch 
     # HIP patches
     %patch190 -p1
     %patch191 -p1
     %patch192 -p1
     %patch193 -p1

   * copied the patches to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
   * rpmbuild --target i686 -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/kernel-2.6.16.9.spec
