AUTOCONF AND AUTOMAKE
=====================

Autoconf and automake tools help developers to avoid from "include
header dependency hell" so they are also used by HIPL in "tools" and
"test" directories. Standard linux kernel supports only plain old
Makefiles, so "linux" subdirectory is not controlled with
autoconf/automake. The "doc" directory uses plain old Makefile because
it uses the same documentation building system as "linux". Libinet6
has been imported from the Usagi project and uses only automake (no
autoconf).

If you need to add or remove source/header files or modify build
rules, edit "Makefile.am". If you need to modify dependencies, edit
"configure.ac". After editing the files, run "autoreconf". Autoreconf
may then update some files (config.h.in, config.sub, configure,
Makefile, Makefile.in) and you need to commit them too into the CVS
along with your new source and header files.

If you need to share a file between userspace and kernelspace, place
it in the kernelspace and modify userspace Makefile.am to create a
link to it from userspace (CVS does not accept links). For example,
"tools/Makefile.am" makes a local link to
"hipl/linux/net/ipv6/builder.c" by the following rule:

	builder.c:
        	$(LN_S) ../linux/net/ipv6/hip/builder.c .


CODING CONVENTIONS
==================

- All kernelspace code should follow the standard linux coding conventions
  listed in <linux_root>/Documentation/CodingStyle

- All code shared between userspace and kernel should follow kernel
  coding style.

- HIPL code should use the prefix "hip_" in all function and global variable
  definitions to avoid namespace pollution in the kernel. The prefix is
  not necessary in userspace code, but the same naming conventions might
  be clearer to use anyway.

- The width of one line should be limited to 80 characters in
  userspace code. This rule may be relaxed in the kernel code because
  the space is very limited due to the 8 character indentation.

QUICK-AND-DIRTY ARCH INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEVELOPERS
================================================

These instructions assume that you want to access the HIPL source code
using ssh. Note: tla and bazaar provide the same functionality but
bazaar was faster and more user friendly when this was written.

# Register an account:
#
baz register-archive hipl-dev@freelists.org--hipl \
       sftp://mkomu@hipl.hiit.fi/var/archive/hipl
baz my-default-archive hipl-dev@freelists.org--hipl

# Get a working copy from the main branch:
#
baz get hipl--main--2.6 hipl--main--2.6

# Copy the tla hook if you want to get your commit logs to the mailing list:
#
cp hipl--main--2.6/test/tla-hook ~/.arch-params/hook

# Different ways to commit code:
#
a) baz commit # Open's your default editor and commits.
b) emacs `tla make-log`; tla commit
c) baz commit -s "Explanation jaada jaada"

# How to check what your have modified in the tree
#
baz changes

# How to make a branch from the current version of the main branch
#
baz my-default archive # Make sure that you are accessing the HIPL archive
baz archive-setup hipl--mybranch--2.6
baz tag hipl--main--2.6 hipl--mybranch--2.6

# Get the new branch
#
baz get hipl--mybranch--2.6 hipl--mybranch--2.6

# How to synchronize branches... remember to make clean commits, i.e. do
# NOT commit a merge and local modifications in the same commit!
#
cd hipl--mybranch--2.6
baz changes # Check that the tree is unmodified
baz star-merge hipl--main--2.6

--- Optional ---

Below are some instructions on using revision libraries. They speed-up
tla/baz operations.

# Make a revision library (otherwise e.g. commit and changes take up to
# 15 mins!)
#
mkdir ~/.tla-rev-lib
baz my-revision-library ~/.tla-rev-lib/
baz library-config --greedy --sparse ~/.tla-rev-lib/

# Get a working copy from the main branch using revision libraries:
#
baz get --link hipl--main--2.6 hipl--main--2.6

Also, the tla usage is optimized using hard-linked revision
libraries.

# Run the command below in your working copy (e.g. monthly) if you
# experience a serious slow-down in the commit speed or you want to enable
# revision libraries in your local copy:
#
cd hipl--main--2.6
baz changes --link


ARCH POLICY
===========

*** Important: see that your umask is 0002 before you make any commits ***

hipl--main--2.6 is the "stable" branch for HIPL code. Do not put any
experimental code in there because other people are relying on that
the code works! Commit only minor bugfixes directly to the stable
branch, and use/create other branches to develop experimental
code. When you have tested and are sure that code works, you can merge
it into the stable branch.

Some points in the branch quality assurance:

- the code must compile as it is without errors
- compiler warning messages must be taken seriously and must not be ignored
  unless you really know what the message means. And we REALLY mean really.
- the base exchange should be manually tested between two hosts
- UPDATE packet exchange should work
- the code should not leak memory or do bad locking
- (all existing unit tests should be run without any errors (see TESTING))

UPGRADING THE KERNEL
====================

# note: there is a perl script called "hashline" diff which is more
# convinient to use in upgrading the kernel (to check for added/deleted
# files)

% <get the patch to ~/down>
% cd hipl--fix--2.6/linux
% patch -p1 <~/down/patch-2.6.7 2>&1| tee /tmp/PATCH_LOG
% grep ^patching /tmp/PATCH_LOG|cut -d' ' -f3 >/tmp/CHANGES
% for i in `cat /tmp/CHANGES`; do tla id $i 2>&1; done >/tmp/TLA_LOG
% tla add `perl -ne 'print "$_" if ($n); $n=0; $n=1 if
    (/id: untagged file/)' </tmp/TLA_LOG`
% tla delete `perl -ne 'print "$_" if ($n); $n=0; $n=1 if
  (/error finding file id \(2: No such file or directory\)/)' \
    </tmp/TLA_LOG|cut -d' ' -f3`
% find . -type d|grep -v .arch-ids >/tmp/LINUX_DIRS
% for i in `cat /tmp/LINUX_DIRS`; do tla id $i 2>&1; done
    >/tmp/TLA_DIR_LOG
% tla add `perl -ne 'print "$_" if ($n); $n=0; $n=1 if
    (/id: untagged file/)' </tmp/TLA_DIR_LOG`

Check HUNK messages from PATCH_LOG manually.

DEBUGGING
=========

Debugging the kernel with gdb is not possible unless you're running
User Mode Linux and in such cases you may prefer manual debugging
statements in the code. It may be also your personal favourite to
prefer debugging statements over gdb in the userspace. HIPL provides a
set of wrappers for adding debugging statements in a concise way:

- HIP_DIE(arguments as for printk)
- HIP_ERROR(arguments as for printk)
- HIP_INFO(arguments as for printk) 
- HIP_DEBUG(arguments as for printk) 

The wrappers exists for many reasons. First, it is very convinient to
have the same syntax for the debug statements indepently of whether
you degugging in kernel or userspace.

Second, an "ad hoc" debug statement mechanism would make it more
difficult to adopt HIPL into production environment because it would
be awkward to comment all the superfluous debug messages. The
superfluous debug messages can be suppressed by a single switch to
configure (CONFIG_HIP_DEBUG) if an unified interface for debugging is
used.

Third reason for the existance of wrappers is that a uniform
importancy level of debug messages can be enforced. For example, error
messages are more important than info messages and info messages are
more important than debug messages. One benefit of the importancy of
levels is that the debug messages can be cathegorized into two groups:
the ones that are always included in a build and the ones that are
included only in a development build. HIP_DEBUG belongs to the latter
group and the other functions belong to the second group.

The fourth reason for justifying the wrappers is that some programs
cannot be run interactively on the screen in production
environment. For example, the HIP daemon is preferred to be run as a
background process in production environment by the end-users. The
debug statements cannot be printed on the screen in such a case;
instead, the statements have to passed via syslog. On the other hand,
the developer wants to run the daemon interactively. The wrappers make
it possible to please both of the groups easily.

Debug statements should not be removed from code because someone may
have use for the debug statement later on. The preferred way is to put a
"_" in front of the debug function name to prevent the debug statement
to ever to be shown (indepently of whether the build is a development
or production build):

- _HIP_DIE(..)
- _HIP_ERROR(..)
- _HIP_INFO(.. 
- _HIP_DEBUG(..) 

DOCUMENTATION
=============

The list of available HIPL documentation is listed in README. Both the
kernel and the userspace API are documented in Linux kernel docbook
format (see hipl/linux/Documentation/DocBook). Here is an example how
docbook style comments should be used for commenting functions:

/**
 * sum2 - sum the given two integers
 * @a: the first integer to be summed
 * @b: the second integer to be summed
 *
 * the freeform longer description goes here (may
 * span multiple lines)
 *
 * Returns: the sum of @a and @b.
 *
 */
int sum2(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}


NOTE!

- The first two stars are REQUIRED. Otherwise docbook does not
  include the function in its output.
- The summary line may be just ONE line.
- The description of the parameters must begin IMMEDIATELY on the
  next line after the function summary. Otherwise you will experience    
  odd docbook behaviour (the descriptions appear twice in the text).
- Please use the following indentation type for the parameters:
    @test:   blah blah
    @foobar: description of foobar
             continues to the next line
- You can refence other functions by adding empty brackets() after the
  function name.
- see Documentation/kernel-doc-nano-HOWTO.txt for more details on
  documentation styles

SUBMITTING PATCHES
==================

HIPL is still work in progress. The code is being constantly developed
and it may be difficult to merge your contribution to the HIPL code.

If you still want to submit patches to the HIPL project, see that the
patch follows the CVS POLICY (see above). Build your patches against
the HEAD branch in CVS.  It would be nice if you would build one (or
multiple) unit test case to validate your patch.

TESTING
=======

The project has a tailored unit testing environment which makes it
possible to run tests in the HIP kernel module and userspace. It is
recommended that the developer builds a new test case when creating
new functionality or repairing old functionality. Still, there are
some tangled functionality, especially in the kernel, that is
very difficult to test with unit testing. Manual black box testing
should be used to cover changes in the code in such cases.

PREBUILT BINARY PACKAGES
========================

Note well: Currently the status of the packaging scripts is in very initial
phase. They are not tested throughly.

Two separate packages are planned to be provided by HIPL: one for user
space software and the other for kernel and kernel modules. Currently only
scripts for building user space packages exist.


There are scripts in directory test/packaging that can be used to create
binary packages. The aim for these packages is for easier testing of HIPL
software. With the scripts, RPM (e.g. for Fedora Core) and DEB (for Debian)
packages can be created. 

To create the RPM package, go to the directory test/packaging. Then run
./create-hip-us-pkg. This will create a source package (in tar.gz form in
the same directory) which will be used when building the RPM file. After
the script has run successfully, follow the instructions given by the
script. That is, login as root and copy the source package (e.g.
hipl-userspace-1.0-1.tgz) to directory /usr/src/rpm/SOURCES. Then issue the
command "rpmbuild -ba <hiplroot>/test/packaging/hipl-userspace-1.0-1.spec".
When everyting is finished successfully, there will be a binary RPM package
"/usr/src/rpm/RPMS/i386/hipl-userspace-1.0-1.i386.rpm". The package can
then be installed with rpm -i.

DEB package is created similarly. First go to the directory test/packaging
and then run ./create-hip-us-deb. The resulting package file is placed into
the same directory. The package can be installed using dpkg, e.g. "dpkg -i
hipl-userspace_1.0-1_i386.deb".
