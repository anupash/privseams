 About
=======

The directory UNSUPPORTED contains files which are not used by the current
version of hipl--tiny. These files were moved from project root (keeping
the folder structure).

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF THIS CODE!

The code in this directory may have various dependencies to other files in the
tiny HIP project. Most of the functionality is not needed a the moment, but may
be implemented as a module in the new project structure. Therefore the source
code is not deleted, but moved here.
