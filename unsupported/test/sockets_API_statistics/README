1. Introduction
sockets API statistics is for counting how many socket API used in legacy applications.  
The application uses sockets_analysis.conf file to keep the socket API (function calls
and strutures) which needs to be counted and where to download applications. The applications are
downloaded understand applications directory, the sockets analysis data (times of socket API call) is kept into database which is under the db directory. 


2. Running Requirment

Python >= 2.5
apsw >= 3.3.5-r1
SQLITE >= 3.4.2


3. Code 


run.py -----> run application file (python run.py)

database_engine.py   ---> sqlite database engine for saving analysis socket APIs
			  into database



fetch_files.py   -----> download network applications source code from internet 
			and decompress them based on names in the applications 
					sections of sockets_analysis.conf config file.

conf_reader.py    ------> read configuarion file (sockets_analysis.conf)


file_input.py    --------> read c source code file and return code without 
			comments line (parsing)

string_token.py -------> string lexical token analysis

directory_walking.py  -------> Directory walking


sockets_analysis.conf ---> This configuration file is used to keep all sockets 
			   networking API function calls and struct data types



4. How to run application
python run.py


Notice: when to add application to download in the applications section from the sockets_analysis.conf 
file, the application name should be unique, and application name should be part of download file name.
   

5.How to open database file and dump analysis database 

It is easy to open database files with GUI applcaition called SQLITE Studio (check from 
http://sqlitestudio.one.pl/)

Converting An Entire Database To An ASCII Text File

Use the ".dump" command to convert the entire contents of a database into a single ASCII text file. 
This file can be converted back into a database by piping it back into sqlite3.

A good way to make an archival copy of a database is this in our case:

    $ echo '.dump' | sqlite3 socket_analysis_data_sos.db | gzip -c >socket_analysis_data_sos.db.dump.gz 

This generates a file named ex1.dump.gz that contains everything you need to reconstruct the database 
at a later time, or on another machine. To reconstruct the database, just type:

    $ zcat socket_analysis_data_sos.db.dump.gz | sqlite3 socket_analysis_data_sos.db 

The text format is pure SQL so you can also use the .dump command to export an SQLite database into 
other popular SQL database engines. Like this:

    $ createdb ex2
    $ sqlite3 socket_analysis_data_sos.db .dump | psql ex2 




6. what should be improved in next release
1) Do not need delete all applications to download again when running application everytime
2) how to update table efficiently, not to delete database and recreate it.
