<h1>Frequently asked questions from distributors</h1>
This page is for people
who want to distribute copies of my software or derivative works:
for example, an operating system that includes the software.
<p>
You don't need to read this page
if you simply want to use my software.
You are <a href="http://cr.yp.to/rights.html">free</a> to
download the software from my web server;
you then own that copy of the software,
and you are <a href="http://cr.yp.to/softwarelaw.html">free</a> to compile it and run it.
</p><p>
You also don't need to read this page
if you simply want to set up a <a href="http://cr.yp.to/mirrors.html">mirror</a>
of my web pages.

<h2>Am I free to modify uncopyrighted packages and distribute modified versions?</h2>
Yes.
But this does not mean that modifications are <i>encouraged</i>!
<p>
Please take time to ensure that your distributions of my software support
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/compatibility.html">exactly the same interface</a>
as everyone else's distributions.
In particular, if you move files,
please set up symbolic links from the original locations,
so that you don't frivolously break scripts that work everywhere else.
</p><h2>Rick Moen says you can revoke these permissions by changing your web page!</h2>
Is that a question?
<p>
Rick Moen is an idiot.
(In case there are several Rick Moens in the world:
I'm talking about <tt>rick@linuxmafia.com</tt>.)
Feel free to ask your attorney to explain waivers to you.
</p><h2>Wait, now Rick Moen says he never said that!</h2>
Is that a question?
<p>
Here's Rick Moen's first public statement (2000.11.09), in his own words:
</p><blockquote>
If you become dependent on Bernstein software,
you run the risk that he might cease development and withdraw it from the Net. Neither you nor
anyone else would then have the legal right to take over development and distribute even the old
versions, let alone new ones. ...
<i>You're betting that Bernstein never changes his mind, if you use qmail.</i>
</blockquote>
(Emphasis added.)
<p>
Here's Rick Moen's second public statement (2001.04.15), in his own words:
</p><blockquote>
Unmodified specific versions of qmail and djbdns (formerly dnscache) may be redistributed -- or at
least so claimed Bernstein's Web pages, recently. Will those continue to be there, to point to?
...
<i>Essentially, you're betting that Bernstein never changes his mind, if you rely on such software.</i>
</blockquote>
(Emphasis added.)
<p>
Here's a subsequent public statement (2001.09.01) from Moen's friend J. Paul Reed:
</p><blockquote>
DJB could, theoretically, retract his sofftware, shutdown his webpages,
and proceed to sue everyone distributing his software.
</blockquote>
(Followed, in the original, by a link to Moen's web page.)
<p>
Here's some subsequent backpedaling by Moen:
``Are you saying that DJB can revoke the licence to his software
by changing or removing his Web pages? No, of course not.''
